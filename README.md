# UltraPlayApi
* A task given to me by [UltraPlay](https://ultraplay.co)

# Notes
* For the **/api/matches/all** endpoint use Postman or another app, because SwaggerUÐ˜ freezes when trying to display all the data, because of the amount that needs to be displayed.
* Running the app on **Kestrel** will give some real time information (via console), when and how much time it takes for the data to be consumed and updated inside the database. This was created purely for debugging purposes.
